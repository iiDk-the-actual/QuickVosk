# QuickVosk
A ~100-line program that runs the attached .wav file through Vosk. Everything runs standalone; no external downloads are required. This program is based on [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/), a free, offline, and open-source program used for voice recognition. This is very useful for quickly creating transcripts of audio files or for using Vosk from projects that do not support it.

## Usage
You may find a prebuilt binary in the [Releases](https://github.com/iiDk-the-actual/QuickVosk/releases) tab
```
Usage: QuickVosk.exe <path-to-audio.wav>
Note: WAV must be mono, 16-bit PCM, 16kHz.
```
